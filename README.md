### How it works:

Rename the folders in your localhost in this format:

  `[project name] | [description] | [thumbnail color]`

- [project name] = Your project name;
- [description] = Your project description;

          `null = localhost project;`

- [thumbnail color] = the color od thumbnail:

          `null = default grey thumb;`
          `1 = yellow thumb;`
          `2 = green thumb;`
          `3 = orange thumb;`
          `4 = blue thumb;`
