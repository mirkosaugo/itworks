an easy localhost luncher :)



It works! is a simple php file (with his small folder dependency) for a cool Directory Listings in your localhost url.



-- Installation:

Copy the source ('index.php' and the folfer '__sources') in your localhost root directory.




-- How it works:

Rename the folders in your localhost in this format:

  [project name] | [description] | [thumbnail color]


[project name] = Your project name;
[description] = Your project description;
[thumbnail color] = the color od thumbnail:
          null = default grey thumb;
          1 = yellow thumb;
          2 = green thumb;
          3 = orange thumb;
          4 = blue thumb;
